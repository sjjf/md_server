#
# mdserver/database.py: a simple single-file database of domain information
# used to manage data for the md_server system.
#
# Data is stored on disk in a simple JSON format, with data being stored as a
# list of JSON objects, each specifying domain information. In memory the data
# is stored as dict keyed by the domain name.
#
# Read operations are performed by reading the whole file, parsing the JSON,
# then creating the domain name keyed dict, along with additional indices to
# asist with queries.
#
# Update operations do the same loading and processing, but then update the
# core dict with new data. The whole core dict is then serialised back to JSON
# and written to a temp file, which is then renamed over the original file to
# complete the process.
#
# JSON format is as follows:
# [
#   {
#     "domain_name": "foo",
#     "domain_uuid": "xx-xx-xx-xx-xx",
#     "domain_metadata": {
#       "md_key1": "value1",
#       "md_key2": "value2",
#     },
#     "mds_mac": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
#     "mds_ipv4": "10.128.0.2",
#     "mds_ipv6": "fe80::128:2",
#     "first_seen": 123456789,
#     "last_update": 123456799
#   }
# ]
