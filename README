Introduction
============

Standalone metadata server to simplify the use of vendor cloud
images with a standalone kvm/libvirt server

- allows the user to provide a cloud-init config via userdata
- cloud-init.conf can be templated, providing access to system
  wide ssh keys as well as manually specified keys
- can manage dnsmasq additional hosts file to enable access to
  instances via their libvirt domain name rather than IP address
- supports setting hostnames, passwords and ssh keys in the
  default configuration

See the sample config file for the full set of configuration
options.

Setup
=====
Add the EC2 IP to the virtbr0 bridge

# ip addr add 169.254.169.254 dev virbr0

Install the following dependencies (either with pip or distro
packages):

- bottle (>= 0.12.0)
- libvirt-python (>= 1.22)

Build and Install the mdserver package

# python setup.py bdist_rpm
# rpm -ivh dist/mdserver-<version>.noarch.rpm

or

# python setup.py install

The configuration file will be installed by default in
/etc/mdserver/mdserver.conf, along with a daemon config file in
/etd/default/mdserver. The default configuration will not be very
useful - edit it to at least add your root/admin user's ssh key
as default, if you plan to use ssh to log into your instances.

User data files are sourced by default from
/etc/mdserver/userdata.

A unit file is provided for systemd based systems, along with a
SysV init script. Start the metadata server as per usual:

# systemctl start mdserver

or

# /etc/init.d/mdserver start

The server can also be run manually:

/usr/local/bin/mdserver /etc/mdserver/mdserver.conf

Logs by default go to /var/log/mdserver.log.

Usage
=====
By default most vendor supplied cloud images will run cloud-init
at boot, which will attempt to contact an EC2 metadata server on
the "magic" IP 169.254.169.254:80. mdserver will listen on this
address, and look for dnsmasq configuration based on the net_name
specified in the config (default 'mds').

mdserver responds to requests by determining the libvirt domain
based on the client IP address and looking for a userdata file
based on the instance name or MAC address, searching for the
following:

- <userdata_dir>/<instance>
- <userdata_dir>/<instance>.yaml
- <userdata_dir>/<MAC>
- <userdata_dir>/<MAC>.yaml

If no instance specific userdata file is found a hard-coded
fallback will be used.

Userdata files are run through Bottle's templating engine,
allowing the user to substitute a number of values from the
mdserver configuration into the generated userdata file. The
currently supported values are:

- all public keys, in the form "public_key_<entry name>"
  i.e. an entry in the [public-keys] section named "default" will
  be available in the userdata template as a value named
  "public_key_default"
- a default password (mdserver_password) - only if set by the
  user!
- the hostname (hostname)

Values can be interpolated into the file using the {{<value>}}
syntax - more sophisticated template behaviour can in theory be
used, but has not been tested.

mdserver can be configured to manage the dnsmasq additional hosts
file for the metadata network. Adding the EC2 magic IP address to
the server's resolv.conf file will allow users to ssh to the
instance by name rather than IP address, greatly simplifying
usage. This functionality is disabled by default, but can be
enabled by setting the manage_addnhosts config entry to true.
When enabled, mdserver will create a DNS entry for the instance
IP address pointing at the instance's libvirt domain name.

Additionally, setting the dnsmasq.prefix config entry will cause
mdserver to add a DNS entry in the form "<prefix><name>" (i.e.
"test-vm145"; setting the dnsmasq.domain config entry will cause
it to add an entry for the fully qualified domain name (i.e.
"test-vm145.example.com", or "vm145.example.com if the prefix is
not set). This behaviour is disabled by default.
