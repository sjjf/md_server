[mdserver]
# Control the way the metadata server itself is configured.
#
# basic configuration
# port=80
# listen_address=169.254.169.254
# loglevel=info
# debug=no
# logfile=/var/log/mdserver.log
#
# location in which to search for a userdata template file
# userdata_dir=/etc/mdserver/userdata
#
# suffixes to try when searching for userdata files - colon separated list
# with the empty string (i.e. no suffix) specified by `::` or by a single
# colon at the start or end of the list
# userdata_suffixes = :.yaml
#
# encrypted root password string to be made available to the userdata template
# password=None
#
# userdata template file to use when nothing matching the host can be found
# default_template=None
#
# location of the persistent instance database
# db_file=/var/lib/mdserver/db_file.json

[public-keys]
# SSH public keys to be made available to the userdata template.
default = not a real key

[dnsmasq]
# Controlling the way that dnsmasq is configured.
#
# directory under which the dnsmasq config files are generated
# base_dir=/var/lib/mdserver/dnsmasq
#
# mds network configuration.
#
# the name of the network we'll find the MAC address in
# net_name=mds
#
# network address/prefix - used during IP address allocation
# net_address=10.122.0.0
# net_prefix=16
#
# the gateway address within the network specified above
# gateway=10.122.0.1
#
# the interface that this network is accessible through (and which has the
# gateway and listen address)
# interface=br-mds
#
# whether to advertise this host as the DNS server
# use_dns=False
#
# the lease length for clients (typically they will renew sometime after the
# half-way point, so this means in practise about a 12 hour renewal cycle)
# lease_len=86400
#
# specify a prefix for the domain name entry, e.g. test-vm1
# prefix=no
#
# specify the domain name for the host
# domain=no
#
# specify the order in which names are added to the hosts file, and how the
# names are generated.
#
# possible options are base, prefix and domain or fqdn.
# base adds an entry for the instance's virsh domain name
# prefix adds an entry of the form <prefix><basename>
# domain adds an entry of the form <prefix><basename>.<domain>.
# if prefix or domain are not set substitutions using those
# values will be ignored
# e.g. entry_order=prefix,domain,base will create the following
# entry:
# <ip> <prefix><basename> <prefix><basename>.<domain> <basename>
# or, if prefix is not set:
# <ip> <basename>.<domain> <basename>
# or, if both prefix and domain are not set:
# <ip> <basename>
# default: base
# entry_order=prefix,domain,base
#
# [template-data]
#
# The template-data section allows the user to specify a set of key=value pairs
# that will be made available to the templating engine. The key is used without
# modification, allowing you to set whatever values you want (as long as there
# is no conflict with an existing config variable). Values are presented as
# strings, so any conversion that is required must be done via python code
# within the template.
#
# In the example below, {{foo}} will be available to the template, with value
# "bar".
#
# foo=bar
#
# To make elements of the rest of the configuration accessible to templates,
# specify a comma separated list of the full section.key names in
# `_config_items_` - these will be copied into the dictionary passed to the
# template, sans the section name (so `dnsmasq.prefix` would become `prefix`).
#
# _config_items_ = dnsmasq.prefix,dnsmasq.domain
#
# [service]
#
# Service information, intended to be used to identify this metadata service to
# cloud-init.
#
# the name can be used to provide information about your site/installation
# name = mdserver
#
# the type should be left at mdserver, as this is the identifying information
# for cloud-init
# type = mdserver
#
# the version can be ignored for the most part, as the default will be set in
# the code
# version = 0.5.0
#
# simple description of the location this service is running.
# default host part of the hostname
# location = localhost
#
# the ec2_versions value is a comma separated list of URL bases, used to build
# all metadata URLs. e.g.
# ec2_versions = 2009-04-04, latest
#
# default: 2009-04-04
# ec2_versions = 2009-04-04
#
# [_include_]
#
# Additional files and directories to include after the main config file.
# Takes the form of a colon separated list, with entries read from left to
# right. The two recognised keys are `files` and `directories`: the latter is
# a list of directories to load all `*.conf` files from, the former is a
# simple list of files to be read. The `directories` list is processed first,
# the `files` list second, both of them are processed after the main config
# file. Whichever file sets a particular section/key last wins.
#
# examples:
# files = /var/lib/mdserver/mdserver-dnsmasq.conf:/etc/mdserver/mdserver-local.conf
# directories = /etc/mdserver/mdserver.conf.d
#
# No defaults, but it makes a lot of sense to specify the following:
#[_include_]
#directories = /etc/mdserver/mdserver.conf.d
