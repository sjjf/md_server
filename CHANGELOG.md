# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project (tries to) adhere to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Replace import of strtobool from distutils.util - the distutils module
  has been deprecated for ages, and has been removed in 3.12.
- Remove use of setup.cfg, moving all project config into pyproject.toml.
- Use setuptools_scm to manage package version. The generated version still
  needs to be integrated into the rest of the system, but it's there now.

### Added

### Fixed

## [0.6.6] - 2023-12-17
### Changed
- Cleanup of logging configuration and behaviour.
- Don't configure dnsmasq to watch files for changes, instead explicitly HUP
  it - this reloads the files in full, which is what we want.
- Update README.md to document newer/better ways of enabling cloud-init in
  images.

### Added
- Support for handling changes to configuration schema - this won't magically
  fix the config, but will log the old to new config key mapping.
- Better testing of the mdserver/dnsmasq interactions.

### Fixed
- Typos, typos, everywhere . . .

## [0.6.5] - 2023-05-07
### Changed
- Updates to the shipped systemd unit files to properly handle the timing
  requirements of the mdserver and dependent dnsmasq services.

### Added
- Support for sending a SIGHUP to the dnsmasq process, to force a reload of
  the updated dhcp/dns hosts files.

### Fixed
- Better and more consisitent logging.

## [0.6.4] - 2023-05-07
### Fixed
- Fixed bug in the database metadata handling.

## [0.6.3] - 2023-05-06
### Fixed
- Fixed bug in instance upload for instances with no metadata. This is
  obviously the common case, so it was a pretty big issue.

## [0.6.2] - 2023-04-06
### Added
- Support for extracting metadata from the domain XML to pass configuration
  items to the mdserver. Currently only used for a userdata prefix that
  overrides the default search patterns, may be used for more later.
- Support for presenting existing config items to templates, to avoid
  duplicating values unnecessarily.
- Simple indicator of service location (defaults to the hostname).

### Fixed
- mdserver.service unit needs to wait on network-online to make sure it can
  bind to the specified address.

## [0.6.1] - 2023-01-26
### Changed
- Updated build configuration - added a `pyproject.toml` file, and updated
  a number of elements of the build system.
- Updated `tests/run-test.sh` script to be a little more repeatable.
- Moved over to black for formatting/linting, since it's more consistent and
  repeatable than the previous rather ill-defined model.

### Added
- Support for splitting up the configuration file. This is intended to make it
  easier to support automatically generated or customised configurations (the
  updated `run-test.sh` script makes use of this).
- This CHANGELOG file.

### Fixed
- Spelling fixes in the README file.
- Properly document the libvirt network configuration (thanks to Alexander E.
  Fischer)
- Fix systemd unit file permissions - systemd complains if they're executable.
- Minor fixes in system integration script.
